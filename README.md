# Open-Source Learning  

Welcome! This repository is my personal space to explore **open-source development** and prepare for **Google Summer of Code (GSOC)**.  

# My Goals  
- Learn **Python** and improve my coding skills  
- Master **Git & GitHub** for collaboration  
- Contribute to **open-source projects**  
- Build confidence to apply for **GSOC**  

This is just the beginning. I'll keep updating my progress and sharing what I learn along the way. Stay tuned!
